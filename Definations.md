# Note

This repository contains **core, general-purpose definitions** and foundational concepts required to build a strong conceptual and mathematical understanding of Machine Learning.

Subject-specific definitions and detailed explanations are organized within the respective sub-categories.

## Definitions

**Data**:  
Data are raw observations or measurements collected from the real world.  
By themselves, data are unstructured, noisy, and meaningless until processed, analyzed, and interpreted.

**Model**:  
A model is a mathematical or computational function that maps inputs to outputs by learning patterns from data.  
It contains parameters that are adjusted during training to make predictions or decisions on unseen data.

**Learning**:  
It is a process in which a model adjusts its parameters to reduce error and improve itself based on data and feedback.

**Vectors**:  
In computer science, a vector is an ordered list of numbers that represent a point and direction in space.  
Each number is called a component or coordinate.  
In Machine Learning, vectors are used to represent data, parameters, gradients, and features, and may exist in any finite dimension.

**Algebra**:  
A formal system of symbols and rules used to represent objects and perform transformations by manipulating them.

**Linear Algebra**:  
The study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate them. Vectors are denoted as *→v*/*v*.

## Important Points

### Goal of Machine Learning

The goal of Machine Learning is to design **general-purpose methodologies to extract valuable patterns from data**.

### Main Concepts of Machine Learning

1. Represent data as **vectors**.  
2. Choose an appropriate **model**, either using the probabilistic or optimization view.  
3. **Learn** from available data using numerical optimization methods so the model performs well on unseen data.

### Four Pillars of Machine Learning

1. **Regression** – predicting continuous values  
2. **Dimensionality Reduction** – compressing data while preserving structure  
3. **Density Estimation** – modelling data distributions  
4. **Classification** – predicting discrete labels
