# Aim

This repository is a structured guide for learners entering Machine Learning.  
It focuses on **precise definitions**, **intuitive mathematical understanding**, and **practical implementation in Python**.

Core mathematical concepts are explained conceptually and **translated into executable Python code** (since video explanations are not provided), demonstrating how the mathematics directly appears in machine learning algorithms.

The goal is **conceptual clarity**, not rote mathematics—bridging abstract theory with real computational practice.  
A strong mathematical background is helpful but not required; **curiosity and consistency matter more**.

## Core Topics

The project is divided into 3 **core topics** essential for Machine Learning:

- **Linear Algebra**  
- **Probability and Statistics**  
- **Calculus**  

Optional mathematical topics will be added later, such as:  
*i. Optimization Theory*, *ii. Discrete Mathematics*, and *iii. Information Theory*.

## Topics Covered

- **Linear Algebra:** vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, transformations  
- **Calculus:** derivatives, gradients, chain rule  
- **Probability & Statistics:** random variables, expectations, distributions  
- **Optimization:** loss functions, gradient descent, convexity
